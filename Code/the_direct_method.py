Based on Briggs K., 1991: https://keithbriggs.info/documents/how-to-calc.pdf
Reference value at https://oeis.org/A006890/constant

The functions below obtain Feigenbaums constant.
One makes use of the double type variable and is constrained by its
accuracy.
The other uses the decimal library to increase its precision, with the
cost of computation time.
This is also implemented in Fortran90 in the_direct_method.f90.

Found in Chapter 3.1.3 Towards an understanding of chaos: Feigenbaum's number - The direct method

This code has been modified in 2024 for the purposes of improving
readability and functionality.
Original version can be found in the appendix.
